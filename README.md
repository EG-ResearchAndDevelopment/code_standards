### This repository contains markdown files that are used as **INTERNAL CODING STYLE** guides for Python. Within the Elektro Gorenjska Research and Development department, we use these guides to ensure that our code is consistent and readable.

This convention guide serves to establish consistency and readability in our python projects. Like all convention guides, this one is imperfect and in some cases, the convention might be at odds with backwards compatibility or code readability. In these cases, the convention should be abandoned. **Readability is more important than strict adherence to the guidelines**.

The repository is organised in the follwoing manner:

This repo consists of the following sections:

- [01 - Naming Conventions](01_naming_convention.md)
- [02 - Code Formatting](02_code_formatting.md)
- [03 - Code Organisation](03_code_organisation.md)
- [04 - Best Practices](04_best_practices.md)
- [05 - Unit Testing](05_unit_testing.md)
- [06 - SQL DWH Basics](06_SQL_DWH_basics.md)
- [07 - Unit Testing](07_SQL_naming_convention.md)
- [08 - Base Names](08_base_names.md)

The guidelines are a simplified version of Google's Python Style Guide. The original guide can be found [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
